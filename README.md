# Coinland
Digital Currency Tracking App powered by  | .Net Core | Clean Arch | DDD | Docker

# Summary

In this repository you will find an app which contains two parts. First part is a Web API which has been built with .Net Core 2.2 and running on a Docker Linux Container.
The second part is a Windows Form App which has been built with .Net Framework 4.7 and communicate with the Web API on Linux to manage all the actions.

# What will be here soon?

CQRS pattern looks really handy for this kind of application. As you may realise that there is nothing implemented on the auth or EF DB side yet. It is open to contribute and critisise.

# Future work and improvements

* Auto buy/sell rules should be set by a user
* Simulation of trading should be possible for significant amount of time or for a limited earn/loss

# What is Coinland?
Coinland is an app to track values of the digital currencies live. It uses public information of the digital currencies and allow you to save your transactions to inform you when there is a change on the value of the currency that you bought.

# Why?
It is a hobby project to get familiar with the .Net Core and Docker technologies.
